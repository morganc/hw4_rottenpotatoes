3.  Create controller and model specs.  Begin by adding the cucumber
scenarios for the "search for movies by director" feature.

Note that cucumber by itself doesn't work, so we have to run
  bundle exec cucumber

I need to keep straight  "([^"]*)"$ and ".*"$


2. Create and apply a migration that adds the "director" field to the
movies table.  The "director" field should be a string containing the
name of the movie's director.

Why is schema.rb not under source control, but development.sqlite3 is?  I will
fix that on the next checkin.
